# UTA PROJECTS:

The purpose of these projects is to utilize open source data published by the UTA and accessible by the public to engineer new features for modeling and Machine learning projects and promote the development and production of privately owned AI projects for the benefit of UTA employees and the services they render to the public.

The Following is a short list (liable to be updated in the future!) of current project under development and their objectives.  Further details on these projects can be found within the individual project folders' proposal statements.
***
### Project 1: Proof of concept of Fixed bussing route predictor
- This Project focuses on the ability to form a consistently accurate time predicting model for fixed buses, utilizing data on stop traffic and route schedules.

### Project 2: Explorations into Incorporating 3rd party data sources.
- work with UDOT to incorporate traffic data collected as features into these projects. Models don't know what they don't know and while routing is at the mercy of only taking into account passenger data rather then a full picture of the traffic systems in Salt Lake City, Utah as a whole it will suffer drastically in accuracy.

### Project 3: Create a Baseline Generator Model
- train a proof of concept model utilizing UTA mapping data combined with the features explored in Project 2 to create a traffic predictor model.
- plausibly could incorporate buses moving in the model at this point as well.

### Project 4: Submit Chaos to the model
- The model is supposed to correctly respond to traffic incidents and planned blockages due to construction and/or events (sports, concerts, etc.)  the purpose of this project will be to train the model to predict how traffic flow will respond to these incidents.

### Project 5: A Dynamic ReRouting system
- Project 5 is an extrapolation of Project 4.  If we can prove the model's ability to accurately, precisely, and consistenly predict traffic response to road incidents, we can determine more quickly detours and quick solution reroutes improving the efficiency of the UTA planning, and Dispatch functions as wells improving quality of life for drivers of fixed routes.
